        <h2> Semantic Elements </h2>
        <p>When buliding web page,we use a combination

            of non semantic <b>HTML</b>and Semantic <b>HTML</b>.
            The word semantic menans <strong><i>"relating to
                    meaning"</i></strong>, so semantic element provide
            information about the content between the opening
            and closing tags. </p>
        <p> By using Semantic <b>HTML</b>,we select
            <b>HTML</b> elements based on their meaning, not
            on how they are presented. Elements such as &lt;div&gt;
            and &lt; span &gt; are not semantic elements since
            they provide no context as to what is inside of those
            tags
        </p>
        <p>For example, instead of using a &lt; div &gt; element
            to contain our header information, we could use a
            &lt; header &gt; element, which is used as a head
            ing section. By using a &lt; header &gt; tag inste
            ad of a &lt; div &gt;, we provide context as to what
            information is inside of the opening and closing tag.
        </p>
        <h2> Why Use Semantic Elements? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people
                with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers
                and browsers are able to interpret the code better</li>
            <li><strong>SEO</strong>: It improves the website
                SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit
                your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify the content of your website
                and
                weight the most important content appropriately. </li>
            <li><strong>Easy to Understand</strong>: Semantic HTML also makes the website's source
                code easier to read for other web developers.</li>



        </ul>
        <p>To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic HTML to going into a store with no signs
            on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, you don't know what products are in those aisles. However,
            stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to
            find the items you need, just like Semantic HTML.</p>
        <p>Many web sites contain HTML code like:&lt;div id="header"&gt;, &lt;div id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div id="main"&gt;,
            &lt;div id="footer"&gt; to indicate header, navigation, main content and footer. </p>
