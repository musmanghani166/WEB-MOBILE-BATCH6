<p>Asslam-o-alikum</p>
<p>lino is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? ( Surat Bagara, -Verse 245)</p>
<p>It should be noted that Allah: who is in need of no one and nothing: instills upon his meri to give Qarz-e-Hasana. because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth_ Allah speaks about garz because it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his message to the Muslim urnmah through the Holy Prophet Muhai-nmad prompting Muslims to spend their- wealth in a certain He says:Oh children ofAclarnl Trust me with 3. our wealth. If you do so, no fire: flood or thieves will be able to rob vou of your money_ Iristead: on be endowed viith your wealth when you most need it. He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themselves_ Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement: the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy The needy ill complain to Allah_ and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about us= the ones who needed it. Allah reply to this and say: -I swear on my respect and gl
    on(1 I will bring you closer to me and push them further away."'</p>
